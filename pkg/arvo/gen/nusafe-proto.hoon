::  +node-executor: applies a message to a node in a route
::
::    Returns a list of return messages (ignored at the toplevel) and the
::    modified node state. The flow of the node-executor is to dispatch to
::    hierarchical set of nodes. Let's say we have the following node tree:
::
::      /
::      /board
::      /board/123
::      /board/456
::
::    The way to think of a message is as a series of function calls. We call
::    +on-route in /, which generates the parent event for +on-route in /board,
::    which generates the parent event in /board/123. You then call /board/123
::    with the user's request. You then route the return value from /board/123
::    to /board, from /board to /, and then use the assumed [%accept
::    ~]/[%reject ~] return call from the toplevel node.
