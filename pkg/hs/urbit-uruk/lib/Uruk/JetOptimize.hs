    TODO Implement pattern matching.
    TODO Handle jets nested within jets.

    ### What should `(add 3 4 5)` compile to?

    Add has arity 2, but we don't want to reduce it.

    There's three kinds of head values:

        1. Things that we *do* want to reduce once saturated.

        2. Things that we want to consider to be opaque.

          - Some of these are actually opaque (arguments)
          - Some of them we just don't want to evaluate during decompilation.

    ### What's the propper way to handle recursion?

    Jet recursion is easy. It will always have the form: `(fix body)`

    Nested recursion is hard. For example,

        /~  %asdf  2
        |=  (x/@ y/@)
        /=  sum  (add x y)
        %.  ~[x y]
        %.  sum
        ..  recur
        |=  (acc xs)
        ?-  xs
        ++  L~       acc
        ++  R[x xs]  (recur (add x acc) xs)
        ==

    Basically, this should not be optimized specially at all. It should
    just be a call to `fix`. For faster code, the compiler should always
    jet recursion points.

    ### What's the propper way to handle branching?

    The simple case is that we see `(iff c t e)`.

      That becomes a branch `?:(c (t ~) (e ~))`

    The other case is that we have a call to `iff` that isn't saturated.

      Same with recursion, this is not our problem.

    Does recognizing this even matter?

      Yes! A recognized branch optimizes to a `goto`. An unrecognized
      branch optimizes to a function call.

    ### What about sum types?

    The simple case, again is `(cas x l r)`.

      This becomes a switch: `?-(c; Lx (l x); Rx (r x))`

    The other case is that we have a call to `cas` that isn't saturated.

      Same with recursion and branching, this is not our problem.

    Does recognizing this even matter?

      Yes! A recognized switch becomes a push and a jump table. An
      unrecognized switch becomes a function call. The function call
      requires pushing callbacks to the stack, and passing a value to
      one of those callbacks. This is real overhead.

    Also, (L x l r) becomes `(l x)` and `(R x l r)` becomes `(R r)`

    ### What about data structures? Sums/Products/Nats

    Skip for now.

      But does it matter?

      I don't know.

      Would allow simplification in some cases.

      But that's getting ahead of ourselves.

    There are three kinds of things

    - Functions that we know how to reduce.
    - Functions that we don't know how to reduce.
    - Functions that we want to turn into control flow.
    - Recursive references.
    - Stack references.

    `Kal` is a function that we don't want to reduce.

    `Clo` is a partially-saturated thing that we *do* know how to reduce.

    `Rec` and `Ref` are recursive calls and stack references.

    `App` is unevaluated function application.

    `Cas` and `Iff` are understood control flow.
